This is the repository for my website: <h2>Anyone Can Code</h2>
On the website there are lessons (written by me) teaching how to use basic HTML. I am working on expanding the content and I hope to soon cover more advanced HTML soon, as well as CSS and JS. It also has a fully functional code editor and page display built using only HTML, CSS, and JS/jQuery. No other libraries inlcuded. I am currently working on the syntax highlighting in the code editor as well. You can check out the website here: https://d4q2.github.io/SyntaxHighlightCodeEditor/

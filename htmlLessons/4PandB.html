      Now we'll learn about some basic formatting elements. First up are <p> and </p>, the p being short for paragraph. Adding these around some text will make it a separate paragraph. Another tag you can use to break up lines is the <br> tag, which is short for break. It has no end tag and you will also sometimes see it written as <br/>, which works as well. Often in the source code of a website the programmers will start a new line after a <br> tag, just to help it look a little more like it really will, but this is not necessary. You can see an example of these below:
    </div>
    <!-- An editor setup -->
    <div class="editorArea">
      <!-- The container that manages the positions of the elements -->
      <div class="container" id="editorZero">
        <!-- Where the user can type code to be run -->
        <div class="editor" contenteditable="true" spellcheck="false">
          <code>
          <!DOCTYPE html>
          <html>
            <head>
              
            </head>
            <body>
              This will be on the same line
              as this.
              <p>This is my first paragraph.</p>
              <p>This is my second paragraph.</p>
              Words on this line<br> these will go on the next line.
              This setup<br>
              makes it easier to tell these will be on a new line.
            </body>
          </html>
          </code>
        </div>
        <!-- The button that copies the code to the display part to run it -->
        <button onclick="compile()" class="runButton">Run</button>
        <!-- Resets the code in the editor area to the basic template -->
        <button onclick="setupTemplate()" class="tempButton">Template</button>
        <!-- The background of the display area -->
        <div class="background">
          <!-- The area where the code output is be displayed -->
          <iframe id="code"></iframe>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!-- Include the main script that manages syntax highlighting and code output display -->
      <script src="../main.js"></script>
    </div>
  </body>
